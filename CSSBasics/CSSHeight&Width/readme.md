# CSS Height and Width:

The CSS `height` and `width` properties are used to set the height and width of an element.The `height` and `width` properties may have the following values:

- auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
- length - Defines the height/width in px, cm etc.
- % - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
- initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
- inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

For example:
```css
div {
  height: 100px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

The `max-width` property is used to set the maximum width of an element. The value of the `max-width` property overrides `width`.Similarly, `min-width` property is used to set the minimum width of an element.

And,The `max-height` & `min-height` property defines the maximum & minimum height of an element respectively.
