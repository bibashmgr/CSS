> # CSS Grid Layout:

- The CSS Grid Layout offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns. 
- A grid layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements.
- An HTML element becomes a grid container when its `display` property is set to `grid` or `inline-grid`.
- You can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:

    - `grid-column-gap`
    - `grid-row-gap`
    - `grid-gap`
- The `grid-template-columns` property can also be used to specify the size (width) of the columns.
- The `grid-template-rows` property defines the height of each row.
